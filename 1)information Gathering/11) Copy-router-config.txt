1) What is Copy-router-config?

â€¢ Copy-router-config is a tool in Kali Linux used to grab configuration files from Cisco routers/switches.
â€¢ It automates downloading the running-config or startup-config using protocols like TFTP, SNMP, or HTTP.
â€¢ Mainly used in network penetration testing or lab environments for auditing router configurations.

_______

2) Why use it?

â€¢ To check for misconfigurations (like weak SNMP community strings).
â€¢ To recover configs for testing/troubleshooting in a lab.
â€¢ To verify security (ensuring routers arenâ€™t leaking configs).

3) How does it work?

1. Attacker/Tester runs copy-router-config.
2. It attempts to pull the routerâ€™s configuration file via SNMP/TFTP/HTTP if access is allowed.
3. If the router is misconfigured (e.g., public SNMP community = "public"), the tool can download configs without authentication.

ðŸ“Œ Example basic syntax:

copy-router-config --target <router_IP> --community <snmp_string>

_____

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Scenario:

â€¢ A Cisco router at 192.168.1.1.
â€¢ SNMP community string = public.
â€¢ Kali machine is on the same LAN.

Steps in lab:

copy-router-config --target 192.168.1.1 --community public

âœ… Result: The tool downloads the running-config file into your Kali machine.
ðŸ‘‰ You can then open the file and see details like:

â€¢ Router passwords (sometimes weakly encrypted).
â€¢ ACLs (Access Control Lists).
â€¢ Network design.

_____

5) Practical Workflow

1. Install (pre-included in Kali):

sudo apt install copy-router-config

2. Run with SNMP community:

copy-router-config - -target <router IP> --community public

3. Output file saved locally -+ open in text editor.
_____

 6) Limitations

â€¢ Works only if SNMP/TFTP/HTTP is enabled and misconfigured.
â€¢ Doesnâ€™t bypass strong authentication (secured routers wonâ€™t be affected).
â€¢ Tool is old and not actively updated (modern Cisco devices may block it)
â€¢ Primarily for lab/testing, not reliable in modern hardened networks.

 7) Summary

â€¢ Copy-router-config = A Kali Linux tool for downloading Cisco router configs using misconfigured services.
â€¢ Useful in pentesting labs to demonstrate risks of weak SNMP/TFTP setups.
â€¢ Not effective against modern, secured networks.
â€¢ Best suited for training, auditing, and awareness rather than real-world exploitation.
