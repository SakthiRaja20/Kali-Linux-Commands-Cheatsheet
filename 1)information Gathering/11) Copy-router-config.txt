How does copy-router-config work?

1. Connects to the Cisco router using protocols like TFTP, FTP, or SCP (sometimes SNMP in automated tools).
2. Requests the running-config or startup-config from the router.
3. Transfers the configuration file to a remote server (e.g., TFTP server or local Kali machine).
4. Saves it as a text file (Copy-router-config.txt) for backup or analysis.
