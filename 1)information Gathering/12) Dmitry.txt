1) What is DMitry?

DMitry is a lightweight command-line reconnaissance tool.
It can collect WHOIS info, Netcraft data, subdomains, emails, and open ports for a given domain or IP address.

â¸»

2) Why use DMitry?

â€¢ One tool â†’ multiple recon techniques in one scan.
â€¢ Helps gather domain registration + hosting info.
â€¢ Finds open ports and basic services.
â€¢ Useful in footprinting phase of penetration testing.

â¸»

3) How does DMitry work?

1. User provides a target (domain/IP).
2. DMitry runs WHOIS lookups (domain + IP block).
3. Contacts Netcraft for hosting information.
4. Uses search engines to find emails + subdomains.
5. Performs a basic TCP port scan.
6. Saves output if -o option is given.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dmitry -winsepo example.com


Flags used:

 -w â†’ Domain WHOIS lookup
-i â†’ IP WHOIS lookup
-n â†’ Netcraft info
-s â†’ Subdomain search
-e â†’ Email search
-p â†’ TCP port scan
-o â†’ Save results to file

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ Host Info:

Host IP â†’ 93.184.216.34
Hostname â†’ example.com

ðŸ”¹ Domain WHOIS (example.com):

Registrar â†’ IANA
Created â†’ 1995-08-14
Updated â†’ 2023-08-14
Expiry â†’ 2030-08-14
Nameservers â†’ a.iana-servers.net, b.iana-servers.net

ðŸ”¹ Subdomain Search:

No additional subdomains found.

ðŸ”¹ Email Search:

No public emails discovered.

ðŸ”¹ TCP Port Scan (on 93.184.216.34):

â€¢ 80/tcp â†’ Open (HTTP)
â€¢ 443/tcp â†’ Open (HTTPS)
â€¢ All other scanned ports â†’ Closed

Interpretation:

â€¢ Domain active until 2030.
â€¢ Hosted by IANA on stable infrastructure.
â€¢ Only web services (HTTP/HTTPS) exposed.
â€¢ No extra subdomains/emails available publicly.

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow

1.Install (if missing):

sudo apt install dmitry

2. Run WHOIS only:

dmitry -w example.com

3.Run full scan:

dmitry -winsepo example.com

4.View saved results:

cat example.com.txt

â¸»

6) Limitations

â€¢ Outdated subdomain/email search (Altavista no longer works).
â€¢ No stealth â†’ scans are noisy and logged by target.
â€¢ Netcraft module gives minimal info.
â€¢ Still fine for labs, but outdated for professional use â†’ replaced by modern tools like theHarvester, Amass, Recon-ng.

7) Summary

What: Recon tool that combines WHOIS, Netcraft, DNS, subdomain/email search, and port scanning.
Why: Quick and simple footprinting of domains/hosts.
How: Uses public databases + basic TCP scanning.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ gave registrar info, DNS servers, IP, and detected HTTP/HTTPS ports.
