1) What is Dnstracer?

Dnstracer is a DNS tracing tool.
It tracks the path a DNS query takes from the root servers down to the authoritative nameserver for a given domain.

â¸»

2) Why use Dnstracer?

â€¢ To understand how DNS resolves a domain step by step.
â€¢ Verify if DNS delegation is configured correctly.
â€¢ Detect misconfigured or hijacked DNS servers.
â€¢ Useful for troubleshooting DNS resolution and pentesting DNS infrastructure.

â¸»

3) How does Dnstracer work?

â€¢ User provides a target domain.
â€¢ Starts at root nameservers (or specified resolver).
â€¢ Queries each step in DNS delegation chain (root â†’ TLD â†’ authoritative server).
â€¢ Prints results showing which servers respond and how the query was resolved.

â¸»

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnstracer example.com

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ Query path:

â€¢ oot servers (.) â†’ referred to .com TLD servers.
â€¢ .com TLD servers â†’ referred to iana-servers.net.
â€¢ iana-servers.net â†’ authoritative for example.com.

ðŸ”¹ Final Result:
example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34

Interpretation:

â€¢ DNS resolution works correctly from root â†’ TLD â†’ authoritative servers.
â€¢ No hijacks or misconfigurations detected.

5) Practical Workflow

1. Install (already in Kali, but in case missing):

sudo apt install dnstracer

2. Trace DNS for a domain:

dnstracer example.com

3. Use a specific starting nameserver:

dnstracer -s 8.8.8.8 example.com

4. Display all intermediate results in detail:

dnstracer -v example.com

6) Limitations

â€¢ Only traces the DNS path, doesnâ€™t enumerate subdomains.
â€¢ Limited to IPv4 by default (IPv6 support may vary).
â€¢ Not stealthy â†’ queries visible in DNS logs.
â€¢ Less useful for reconnaissance; mainly for diagnostics/troubleshooting.

7) Summary

What: DNS tracing tool showing how queries resolve step by step.
Why: Check DNS delegation, detect misconfigs, troubleshoot DNS issues.
How: Starts at root servers and follows chain to authoritative nameserver.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ traced query from root â†’ .com â†’ IANA servers â†’ final IP 93.184.216.34.

Note: Great for DNS troubleshooting; not designed for subdomain discovery like dnsenum or dnsrecon.
