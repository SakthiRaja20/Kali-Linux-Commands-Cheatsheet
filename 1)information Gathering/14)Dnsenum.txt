1) What is Dnsenum?

Dnsenum is a multithreaded DNS information gathering tool.
It automates the process of collecting DNS records, discovering subdomains, brute-forcing hostnames, and mapping domain infrastructure.

â¸»
2) Why use Dnsenum?

â€¢ Automates DNS enumeration process.
â€¢ Finds subdomains and hosts linked to a domain.
â€¢ Collects DNS records (MX, NS, A, TXT, etc).
â€¢ Helps in footprinting and network mapping.
â€¢ Useful during reconnaissance phase of penetration testing.

3) How does Dnsenum work?

1. Takes a target domain as input.
2. Performs standard DNS lookups (A, MX, NS, TXT).
3. Retrieves subdomains from Google (optional).
4. Runs a bruteforce attack on common subdomains list.
5. Identifies IP ranges belonging to the target.
6. Performs reverse lookups on IP ranges.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnsenum example.com

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ DNS Records:

â€¢ A record â†’ 93.184.216.34
â€¢ NS record â†’ a.iana-servers.net, b.iana-servers.net
â€¢ MX record â†’ mail.example.com

ðŸ”¹ Subdomain Discovery:

â€¢  www.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34
â€¢  mail.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.35

ðŸ”¹ Brute-force Hostnames:

â€¢ Checked against internal wordlist â†’ found additional hosts.

ðŸ”¹ Reverse Lookup:

IP â†’ Hostname mappings identified.

Interpretation:

â€¢ Domain mapped with authoritative DNS servers.
â€¢ Discovered mail server (MX) and web server.
â€¢ Subdomains identified â†’ possible attack surface.

5) Practical Workflow

1.Install (already in Kali, but in case missing):

sudo apt install dnsenum

2.Basic scan:

dnsenum example.com

3.Save results to file:

dnsenum example.com > output.txt

4.Use custom wordlist for subdomain brute force:

dnsenum --enum -f /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt example.com

â¸»
6) Limitations

â€¢ Some subdomain discovery relies on Google scraping â†’ may fail if blocked.
â€¢ Brute-force limited by wordlist quality.
â€¢ No stealth â†’ enumeration attempts are visible in DNS server logs.
â€¢ Slower compared to modern tools like Amass or Sublist3r for large-scale recon.

7) Summary

What: DNS enumeration tool for domains.
Why: Maps subdomains, DNS records, mail servers, and IP ranges.
How: Queries DNS records, brute-forces subdomains, reverse lookups.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ discovered authoritative DNS servers, mail server, and active subdomains.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Still useful in labs, but for professional recon, combine with modern subdomain enumeration tools.
