1. What is Cisco-Torch?

Cisco-Torch is a Cisco network auditing tool.
It is used mainly by penetration testers and security researchers to enumerate Cisco devices and check them for common misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
Written in Perl, it can quickly probe large ranges of IPs looking for Cisco routers/switches.

2. Why Use It?

‚Ä¢ Security teams use Cisco-Torch to audit Cisco devices for weak configurations.
‚Ä¢ Attackers could also use it to exploit misconfigured routers.
‚Ä¢ Helps identify:
‚Ä¢ Default/weak passwords
‚Ä¢ Unprotected SNMP access
‚Ä¢ Exposure of Cisco Discovery Protocol

üõ†Ô∏è Example Usage

cisco-torch.pl -A 192.168.1.0/24

-A = aggressive scan, tries multiple methods.

‚Ä¢ Target: 192.168.1.0/24 (a whole subnet).
‚Ä¢ Bruteforce with dictionary:

cisco-torch.pl -b -U users.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.1.1

-b = brute force
-U = usernames list
-P = passwords list

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Cisco-Torch is an old tool (not actively maintained). Many features may not work on modern Cisco IOS versions. Modern alternatives include Nmap NSE scripts, Hydra, or SNMP-check.
