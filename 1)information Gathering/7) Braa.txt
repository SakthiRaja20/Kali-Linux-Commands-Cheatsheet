1) What is braa?

braa is a SNMP scanner.
It can query SNMP-enabled devices (like routers, switches, servers) across a network.
Works very fast â†’ can send multiple SNMP requests in parallel.

____

2) Why use braa?

To find SNMP-enabled hosts in a network.
To collect SNMP information (like system name, uptime, interfaces).
Useful in network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment, since SNMP is often misconfigured with default or weak community strings.

____

3) How does braa work?

You provide a target (IP range) and an SNMP community string (like public).
braa sends SNMP queries (GET requests).
Devices that respond are listed with their details.
Results can be saved to a file (like braa.txt).

____

4) Lab Example

Command:

braa public@192.168.1.0/24:.1.3.6.*
public â†’ SNMP community string

192.168.1.0/24 â†’ target subnet

.1.3.6.* â†’ OID (Object Identifier) to query (MIB tree info)

____

5) Practical Workflow

Identify the target subnet.
Run braa with the community string (public, private, or custom).
Save results to a file (braa.txt).
Analyze which devices respond to SNMP queries.

____

6) Limitations

Requires SNMP to be enabled on target devices.
Needs community string (default = public), otherwise no response.
Only works in local/accessible networks.
No longer actively developed (but still useful in labs).
Can be noisy and easily detected in enterprise environments.

____

7) Summary

What: braa is a fast SNMP scanner.
Why: To discover SNMP-enabled devices and collect info.
How: Send SNMP requests âžœ receive system info.
Limitations: Needs SNMP + correct community string, outdated but works for learning.
