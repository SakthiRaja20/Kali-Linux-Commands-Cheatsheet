1) What is Dnsrecon?

Dnsrecon is a powerful DNS enumeration tool in Kali Linux.
It performs standard record lookups, reverse lookups, brute-force, zone transfers, and Google/OSINT-based subdomain discovery.

2) Why use Dnsrecon?

â€¢ To gather DNS information during reconnaissance.
â€¢ etect zone transfer vulnerabilities.
â€¢ Discover subdomains and hosts via brute force and OSINT.
â€¢ Enumerate DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, TXT).
â€¢ Map the attack surface of a domain.

3) How does Dnsrecon work?

â€¢  User provides a domain/IP.
â€¢ Queries DNS servers for all standard records.
â€¢ Performs reverse lookups on discovered IP ranges.
â€¢ Brute-forces subdomains using wordlists.
â€¢ Tries zone transfer (AXFR) against nameservers.
â€¢ Can export results into XML/JSON/CSV for reporting.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnsrecon -d example.com

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ DNS Records:

â€¢ A â†’ 93.184.216.34
â€¢ NS â†’ a.iana-servers.net, b.iana-servers.net
â€¢ MX â†’ mail.example.com
â€¢ TXT â†’ v=spf1 -all

ðŸ”¹ Subdomain Enumeration:

â€¢ www.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34
â€¢ ftp.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.36

ðŸ”¹ Reverse Lookup:

93.184.216.34 â†’ www.example.com

ðŸ”¹ Zone Transfer Attempt:

Tried against a.iana-servers.net â†’ Failed (Transfer not allowed).

Interpretation:

â€¢ Domain mapped with authoritative DNS + mail server.
â€¢ Exposed FTP subdomain â†’ potential attack surface.
â€¢ Zone transfer blocked (secure configuration).

5) Practical Workflow

1. Install (already in Kali, but in case missing):

sudo apt install dnsrecon

2.Basic domain scan:

dnsrecon -d example.com

3.Brute-force subdomains:

dnsrecon -d example.com -D /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt -t brt

4.Attempt zone transfer:

dnsrecon -d example.com -t axfr

5.Save results (CSV/JSON):

dnsrecon -d example.com -t std --json results.json

6) Limitations

â€¢ Brute-force effectiveness depends on wordlist quality.
â€¢ Zone transfer attempts often blocked on secured DNS.
â€¢ Can be noisy â†’ visible in DNS logs.
â€¢ For large domains, enumeration may take time.

7) Summary

What: DNS enumeration and subdomain discovery tool.
Why: Collect DNS records, find subdomains, check for zone transfers.
How: Performs standard lookups, brute-force, reverse lookups, OSINT.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ found web/mail/FTP records, confirmed zone transfer blocked.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: More advanced and flexible than dnsenum or dnsmap.
