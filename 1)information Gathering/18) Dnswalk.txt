1) What is Dnswalk?

Dnswalk is a DNS zone file and consistency checker.
It analyzes DNS information for a target domain and verifies that records are properly configured.

â¸»

2) Why use Dnswalk?

â€¢ To perform a DNS audit on a domain.
â€¢ Detect misconfigurations in DNS records.
â€¢ Check for consistency across DNS servers.
â€¢ Identify zone transfer vulnerabilities.
â€¢ Useful for troubleshooting and security testing.

â¸»

3) How does Dnswalk work?

1.User provides a domain.
2.Tool queries DNS servers for the zone information.
3.If zone transfer (AXFR) is allowed, it downloads the zone file.
4.Runs checks on:
        â€¢ SOA (Start of Authority) records.
        â€¢ MX (Mail) records.
        â€¢ NS (Nameserver) records.
        â€¢ A/AAAA records consistency.
5.Reports errors, warnings, or misconfigurations.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnswalk example.com

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ Zone transfer attempt:

â€¢ a.iana-servers.net â†’ Transfer refused.
â€¢ b.iana-servers.net â†’ Transfer refused.

ðŸ”¹ DNS Checks:

â€¢ SOA record â†’ OK.
â€¢ MX record â†’ mail.example.com exists, reachable.
â€¢ NS consistency â†’ Both authoritative servers match.
â€¢ A record â†’ 93.184.216.34 resolved.

Interpretation:

â€¢ Zone transfer correctly blocked (secure config).
â€¢ DNS servers consistent and functioning.
â€¢ No major misconfigurations found.

â¸»

5) Practical Workflow

1.Install (already in Kali, but in case missing):

sudo apt install dnswalk

2.Run a basic scan:

dnswalk example.com

3.Perform a full recursive check:

dnswalk -r example.com

4.Save results to a file:

dnswalk example.com > results.txt

â¸»

6) Limitations

â€¢ Depends on zone transfer availability (often disabled on secure DNS).
â€¢ Primarily for audit/troubleshooting, not subdomain discovery.
â€¢ Can be noisy â†’ logged by DNS servers.
â€¢ Outdated compared to modern tools like dnsrecon or amass.

7) Summary

What: DNS audit and consistency-checking tool.
Why: Verify DNS zone integrity and detect misconfigurations.
How: Performs zone transfers (if allowed), validates DNS records.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ checked SOA, MX, NS, A records, confirmed zone transfer blocked.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Great for DNS administrators and labs, but limited in pentesting due to modern security hardening.
