1) What is arp-scan?

arp-scan is a network discovery tool that uses the ARP protocol to identify active devices on a local network.
Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
Sends ARP requests to all hosts in a subnet and collects replies.
___

2) Why use arp-scan?

Quickly finds all live hosts on a LAN (faster than ping scans).
Works even if hosts block ICMP (ping) or other probes.
Reveals both IP addresses and MAC addresses.
Useful for network inventory, troubleshooting, and pentesting.

____

3) How does arp-scan work?

You specify a target network/subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
arp-scan sends ARP requests to every IP in the subnet.
Devices that exist on the LAN reply with their MAC + IP address.
Results are displayed in a table.

____

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:
sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 192.168.1.0/24

Sample Output:

192.168.1.1    00:11:22:33:44:55   Cisco Systems
192.168.1.10   08:00:27:ab:cd:ef   PCS Systemtechnik
192.168.1.20   9c:5c:8e:12:34:56   Apple, Inc.

ðŸ‘‰ Interpretation: Found 3 devices, showing IP, MAC address, and vendor.

____

5) Practical Workflow

Identify network interface
ip addr show

Run arp-scan on subnet

sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 192.168.1.0/24

Optional: Scan whole local net with automatic interface detection

sudo arp-scan --localnet

____

6) Limitations

Only works on the local subnet (Layer 2 broadcast domain).
Cannot scan across routers or remote networks.
Some devices may ignore ARP requests (stealth/security settings).
Can be noisy and alert monitoring systems.

_____
7) Summary

What: arp-scan is a tool to discover live hosts on a LAN.
Why: Fast and reliable host discovery, even when ping is blocked.
How: Sends ARP requests âžœ gets MAC + IP replies.

Lab Use Case: Found 3 devices in a home LAN with IP, MAC, and vendor info.
