1) What is Dnsmap?

Dnsmap is a subdomain brute-forcing tool.
It tries common hostnames against a target domain to discover hidden subdomains and map the DNS attack surface.

â¸»

2) Why use Dnsmap?

1. Quickly finds subdomains that may not be publicly listed.
2. Helps discover hidden servers (dev, test, mail, VPN, etc.).
3. Useful in footprinting and attack surface discovery.
4. Can generate a wordlist of found subdomains for further tools.

3) How does Dnsmap work?

1. Takes a target domain as input.
2. Uses an internal wordlist (or custom) of common subdomains.
3. Queries DNS servers for each entry.
4. Outputs valid subdomains + their IP addresses.
5. Optionally saves results to a text file.

4) Exact Use Case (Lab Example)

Command:

dnsmap example.com

Observed Results (sample output):

ðŸ”¹ Discovered Subdomains:

â€¢ www.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34
â€¢ mail.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.35
â€¢ ftp.example.com â†’ 93.184.216.36

ðŸ”¹ Output Saved:

â€¢ Results written into dnsmap_example.com.txt

Interpretation:
â€¢ Found multiple hosts related to the domain.
â€¢ Indicates different services (web, mail, FTP).
â€¢ These may be tested for vulnerabilities.

5) Practical Workflow

1. Install (already in Kali, but in case missing):

sudo apt install dnsmap

2. Run basic scan:

dnsmap example.com

3.Save results to file:

dnsmap example.com -r results.txt

4. Use custom wordlist:

dnsmap example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt

â¸»
6) Limitations

â€¢ Relies on wordlists â†’ may miss uncommon subdomains.
â€¢ No Google/OSINT integration (unlike dnsenum).
â€¢ Not stealthy â†’ enumeration visible in DNS logs.
â€¢ Slower on very large wordlists.

7) Summary

What: Subdomain brute-forcer in Kali Linux.
Why: Identify hidden services/subdomains.
How: Uses DNS queries with a wordlist.
Use Case: Example.com â†’ discovered www, mail, ftp subdomains with IPs.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Great for labs + quick checks, but should be combined with advanced tools like Amass/Sublist3r for full recon.
